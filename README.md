# Woila
- A simple utility to change your wallpaper's colour theme to popular ones such as catpuccin, dracula, tokyonight, nord, gruvbox in a single click.

## How it works?
- It iterates over each pixel of the image and find the closest colour from the selected theme using 3d distance formula where x,y,z co-ordinates represents the r,g,b value of each pixel

> [!NOTE]  
> May not work with complex wallpapers, having several details and colours but should work fine for normal wallpapers
